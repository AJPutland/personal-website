A simple personal portfolio website I built to talk about me and show off some projects I've done. Built following [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org). Take a look at it here [ajputland.com](https://ajputland.com)

## Tools used üîß

* [**GatsbyJS**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [
**REACT**](https://reactjs.org/)
