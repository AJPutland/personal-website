A simple personal portfolio website I built to talk about me and show off some projects I've done. Built following [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org). Take a look at it here [ajputland.com](https://ajputland.com)

## Tool used üîß

[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [REACT](https://reactjs.org/)/
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution /
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for testing before deployment to Netlify /

This project is built such that pushing a Git commit will trigger Travis-CI tests and automatic deployment to Netlify.
